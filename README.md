</p>

Delegate tasks to OpenAI Codex agents. Exec mode uses detached processes (no tmux required); interactive mode uses tmux TUI. Designed for Claude Code orchestration.

Spawn parallel coding agents, monitor their progress, and capture results — all from Claude Code or the command line. Supports two execution modes: **exec** (default, spawn runner, auto-completes) and **interactive** (tmux TUI with send support and idle detection). Job metadata stored in SQLite (WAL mode) with JSON fallback.

## Installation

### As a Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)

**Step 1:** Add the marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add yelban/codex-orchestrator
```

**Step 2:** Install the plugin:

```
/plugin install codex-orchestrator
```

**Step 3:** Restart Claude Code (may be required for the skill to load)

**Step 4:** Install the CLI and dependencies:

```
/codex-orchestrator init
```

Or say "set up codex orchestrator" and Claude will walk you through it.

**Step 5:** Use it - just ask Claude to do things. The skill activates automatically for coding tasks.

### Manual / CLI-Only Install

If you just want the `codex-agent` CLI without the Claude Code plugin:

```bash
# Prerequisites
brew install tmux              # macOS (or apt/pacman/dnf for Linux)
npm install -g @openai/codex   # OpenAI Codex CLI
codex --login                  # Authenticate with OpenAI

# Install
git clone https://github.com/yelban/codex-orchestrator.git ~/.codex-orchestrator
cd ~/.codex-orchestrator && bun install

# Add to PATH (add this line to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export PATH="$HOME/.codex-orchestrator/bin:$PATH"

# Verify
codex-agent health
```

Or use the automated installer:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yelban/codex-orchestrator/main/plugins/codex-orchestrator/scripts/install.sh)
```

### Requirements

| Dependency | Purpose | Install |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) | Terminal multiplexer - interactive mode only (exec mode doesn't need it) | `brew install tmux` |
| [Bun](https://bun.sh) | JavaScript runtime - runs the CLI | `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install \| bash` |
| [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) | OpenAI's coding agent - the thing being orchestrated | `npm install -g @openai/codex` |
| OpenAI account | API access for Codex agents | `codex --login` |

**Platform support:** macOS and Linux. Windows users should use WSL.

## Why?

When you're working with Claude Code and need parallel execution, investigation tasks, or long-running operations - spawn Codex agents in the background. They run in tmux sessions so you can:

- **Watch live** - Attach to any session and see exactly what the agent is doing
- **Talk back** - Send follow-up messages mid-task to redirect or add context
- **Run in parallel** - Spawn multiple agents investigating different parts of a codebase
- **Capture results** - Grab output programmatically when agents finish

Claude handles the strategic thinking (planning, synthesis, communication). Codex handles the deep coding work (research, implementation, review, testing). Together they cover both the orchestration and execution layers.

## Codebase Map (Recommended)

The `--map` flag injects `docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md` into every agent's prompt, giving them instant understanding of your entire codebase: file purposes, module boundaries, data flows, dependencies, and navigation guides.

Without a map, agents waste time exploring and guessing at structure. With a map, they know exactly where things are and start working immediately.

The map is generated by [Cartographer](https://github.com/kingbootoshi/cartographer), a companion Claude Code plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add kingbootoshi/cartographer
/plugin install cartographer
/cartographer
```

This creates `docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md`. After that, every `codex-agent start ... --map` command gives agents full architectural context. **Generate a codebase map before using codex-orchestrator on a new project** - it's the difference between agents that fumble around and agents that execute with precision.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start an agent (exec mode — auto-completes when done)
codex-agent start "Review this codebase for security vulnerabilities" --map
codex-agent start "Refactor auth module" --wait --notify-on-complete 'printf "\033[0;32mCodex agent done\033[0m\n"'

# Start in interactive mode (supports send for mid-task redirection)
codex-agent start "Analyze the auth module" --map --interactive

# Check status with structured JSON
codex-agent jobs --json

# See what it's doing
codex-agent capture <jobId>

# Redirect the agent mid-task (interactive only)
codex-agent send <jobId> "Focus on the authentication module instead"
```

## Jobs JSON Output

Get structured job data with `jobs --json`:

```json
{
  "id": "8abfab85",
  "status": "completed",
  "elapsed_ms": 14897,
  "tokens": {
    "input": 36581,
    "output": 282,
    "context_window": 258400,
    "context_used_pct": 14.16
  },
  "files_modified": ["src/auth.ts", "src/types.ts"],
  "summary": "Implemented the authentication flow..."
}
```

## Examples

### Parallel Investigation

```bash
# Spawn multiple agents to investigate different areas
codex-agent start "Audit authentication flow" -r high --map -s read-only
codex-agent start "Review database queries for N+1 issues" -r high --map -s read-only
codex-agent start "Check for XSS vulnerabilities in templates" -r high --map -s read-only

# Check on all of them
codex-agent jobs --json
```

### Redirecting an Agent (Interactive Mode)

```bash
# Start in interactive mode to enable send
codex-agent start "Investigate auth flow" --map --interactive

# Agent going down wrong path? Redirect it
codex-agent send abc123 "Stop - focus on the auth module instead"

# Agent needs info? Send it
codex-agent send abc123 "The dependency is installed. Continue with typecheck."

# Attach for direct interaction
tmux attach -t codex-agent-abc123
# (Ctrl+B, D to detach)
```

### With File Context

```bash
# Include specific files in the prompt
codex-agent start "Review these files for bugs" -f "src/auth/**/*.ts" -f "src/api/**/*.ts"

# Include codebase map for orientation
codex-agent start "Understand the architecture" --map -r high
```

## How It Works

### Exec Mode (Default — Spawn Runner)

1. You run `codex-agent start "task"`
2. CLI generates a launcher script (`.sh`) and spawns it as a detached child process
3. The launcher pipes your prompt (from file) to `codex exec` via `tee` (for logging)
4. It returns immediately with the job ID
5. Codex works in the background and auto-exits when done
6. Exit code is written to `.exitcode` file — `refreshJobStatus` checks PID + exit code for accurate completion/failure
7. You check with `jobs --json`, `capture`, or `output`

> **Note:** Set `CODEX_AGENT_EXEC_RUNNER=tmux` to use tmux for exec mode (legacy behavior with `attach` support).

### Interactive Mode (`--interactive`)

1. You run `codex-agent start "task" --interactive`
2. CLI generates a launcher script with OS-appropriate `script` invocation (always uses tmux)
3. A detached tmux session starts the Codex TUI
4. Your prompt is sent via `send-keys` (or `load-buffer` for >5000 chars)
5. It returns immediately with the job ID
6. Idle detection monitors for completion (30s grace period → auto `/exit`)
7. You can redirect with `send` if the agent needs course correction

### Storage

Job metadata is stored in SQLite (WAL mode) with dual-write to JSON files for backward compatibility. On first run, existing JSON jobs are automatically backfilled into SQLite.

```
~/.codex-agent/
  codex-agent.db          # SQLite database
  jobs/
    <jobId>.json          # Job metadata (dual-write)
    <jobId>.prompt        # Original prompt
    <jobId>.log           # Terminal output
    <jobId>.sh            # Launcher script
    <jobId>.exitcode      # Exit code (spawn mode)
```

Manage with `codex-agent migrate` (bulk JSON→SQLite) and `codex-agent verify-storage` (sync check). Override storage backend with `CODEX_AGENT_STORAGE=json|sqlite|dual`.

Session output is logged via `tee` (exec) or `script` (interactive). Session metadata is parsed from Codex's JSONL files (`~/.codex/sessions/`) to extract tokens, file modifications, and summaries.

All tmux commands use argv arrays (no shell interpolation). User prompts are read from files, never embedded in commands.

## The Claude Code Plugin

When installed as a Claude Code plugin, the **codex-orchestrator skill** teaches Claude how to use the CLI automatically. Claude becomes the orchestrator:

- Breaks your requests into agent-sized tasks
- Spawns agents with the right flags (read-only for research, workspace-write for implementation)
- Monitors agent progress
- Synthesizes findings from multiple agents
- Course-corrects agents that drift off-task

This means you can just describe what you want, and Claude handles the delegation.

The skill follows a pipeline: **Ideation -> Research -> Synthesis -> PRD -> Implementation -> Review -> Testing**. Each stage uses the appropriate agent configuration.

See [plugins/codex-orchestrator/README.md](plugins/codex-orchestrator/README.md) for full plugin documentation.

## Security

- **No shell injection**: All tmux commands use `spawnSync` with argv arrays — user input never touches shell interpretation
- **Prompt isolation**: Prompts are written to `.prompt` files and read by launcher scripts, never embedded in commands
- **Path boundary enforcement**: File loading validates all resolved paths stay within the working directory
- **Restrictive permissions**: Job directory `0o700`, all files `0o600`, atomic writes prevent torn reads
- **Crash detection**: Failed sessions are distinguished from completed ones via completion marker checks

## Tips

- Use exec mode (default) for most tasks — it auto-completes and is simpler
- Use `--interactive` only when you need mid-task `send` communication
- Use `codex-agent send` to redirect interactive agents — don't kill and respawn
- Use `jobs --json` to get structured data (tokens, files, summary) in one call
- Use `--strip-ansi` (or `--clean`) to get parse-friendly output with ANSI and TUI chrome removed
- Use `-r xhigh` for complex tasks that need deep reasoning
- Use `--map` to give agents codebase context (requires docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md)
- Use `-s read-only` for research tasks that shouldn't modify files
- Kill stuck jobs with `codex-agent kill <id>` only as a last resort
